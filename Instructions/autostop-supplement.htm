<p>One of our users, Laz, sent in his experience with installing the autostop 
chip. It is printed here, as it may provide some pointers or additional tips 
during installation.</p>
<p>Start with directions downloaded 
from Pachislo USA, Inc.</p>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><b>What you need:</b></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Three to four conductor, 18-22 gauge stranded wire</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Package of small cable or zip 
ties about 1/8 wide by 3” long</P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">Wirenuts, 
or butt connectors, or wire taps</p>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Rosin core 60/40 .032 diameter 
solder</P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">Multimeter 
(maybe)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Besides the thin wirewrap wire, 
you may want to purchase some  three to four conductor, 18-22 gauge stranded wire. 
It works better 
then wirewrap for running to the door of machine. It is stiffer and color-coded 
so you can tell where each wire goes. (You can see pictures below.) This type 
of wire can be ordered locally, such as from a Radio Shack, or you can order 
it over the internet. You will not want 
it any larger or it may be too large to solder to the chip. You can also use 
a 4 conductor 'bundled' wire. If you are running the wires individually, you 
will &nbsp;probably want to bundle them together with  zip ties or some other method. 
There is a product called split loom tubing that allows entry and exit of the 
wires at locations of your choice.<SPAN

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">There are different ways you 
can connect the wires from the chip to the wires at the coin mechanism::</P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><b>Simple wire nuts, electrical 
tape</b>.</P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">&nbsp;This 
requires you to cut the wire at the coin mech, and splice in the wire from the 
modchip. <b>Advantage</b>: They are fast and can be removed easily. <b>Disadvantage</b>: They are 
not the safest or the most professional looking.</p>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;"><b>Crimp on butt splice 
connectors, regular and heat shrinkable type</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">&nbsp;Once 
again, this requires that you cut the wire at the coin mech, and splice the 
wire from the modchip in. <b>Advantage</b>: Quick and look better; more permanent. 
<b>Disadvantage</b>: Permanent. If you need to make a change, you have to cut 
the old butt splice off, and discard it. The small size 
that will be needed does not always allow for more than one wire per side if you 
use the regular type. The heat shrinkable type may have a larger opening at the 
ends allowing you to put multiple wires in to be crimped.</p>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;"><b>Wire tap connectors</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;"> 
&nbsp;Very neat and professional looking. They are a little hard to find sometimes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;"><b>Advantage</b>: You 
don't need to cut the wire at the coin mech. 
<b>Disadvantage</b>: Need to strip and crimp on male tab connector for the wire you are 
splicing in; cost.</p>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"> If something does not work right with the modification, 
you *will* need a meter to troubleshoot the problem. Pachislo Usa will be happy 
to help.</P>

Notes:</b></p>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Your board should look exactly 
like the one in the picture at Pachislo USA. If it looks even a little different, 
do not solder onto a part that looks different! You may find a part that is 
a different color or style, or the part may be in a different orientation. An example: An 
example; on the boards from my Babel and Azteca Returns machines- the C9 capacitor was not only 
vertical but of a different style which made it difficult for me to solder onto. 
It is important to solder the wires onto the correct side of the part or the 
modification  not work. I 
know, I did it wrong and had to do it all over again. Let me tell you it is a 
lot easier to do it right the first time! I am new to doing stuff on 
electronics. I did not realize it mattered what side I soldered onto. I was 
thinking it was easier to solder on the wires from the outside edge of the 
board. [Editor clarification: If, in a picture, it looks like the wire is on 
the left side of a part, do not solder the wire onto the right side of the part!]</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">On the 2nd instruction page, 
I found that the  wire lengths for pins 5,6,7,8 worked best if they 
are about 1 1/4 inch long. Start with a longer wire and strip insulation off one 
end. Using your teeth rather than wire cutters for the thin wire works well when 
you are stripping longer wires. [Editor note: Teeth! The company is not recommending 
this!] Strip off ¼ inch of insulation, and then use wirecutters or a razor to 
cut it down to 1/16 to 1/8 
inch. After you have successfully stripped wire off one end, cut the wire to 
the desired length (1 1/4&quot;). You now have to strip the other end. You can use your 
teeth again but the wire brakes real easy. I used a utility knife and 
very carefully cut off only as much insulation as needed.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;For pin 1,  a </SPAN>wire length of 2 to 2 ¼ inches 
 worked out well. </P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">For 
pin 2, 3 and 4, I used the heavier 18-22 gauge wire.  I used a soldering iron with a 15 to 30 watt setting. The 
15-watt setting worked best. After wires are soldered onto 
chip, I used a hot glue gun to make the socket stay on the reelstop board. Since 
these are heavier wires, you will probably have to use a needlenose pliers to 
hold each wire near the socket while bending it. If you don't&nbsp;hold onto the wire at where it is soldered 
to chip you may break it off. It does not take much since the socket itself 
has very thin wire. You can see how I bent the wires in a picture below.</p>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">When running the wires to the game 
start lever and the coin mechanism,  I followed other bundled wires that were 
already in the machine. This way, I could use cable clamps that were already 
part of the machine. At some places, I used cable ties to keep 
all the wires secure and not get in the way of moving parts. A hot glue gun also 
worked to secure wires when there was nothing to secure them to. Some machines 
will have a plastic coil that wraps around wires near the door. If your machine 
has this plastic coil, you can run your wires from the modchip through it. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">When splicing the wires into the 
game start lever and the coin mechanism I tried lots of things. First, I  tried scraping off some of the 
insulation from the coin mech wire and wrapping the wire from the modchip around 
it. Then, I realized I should probably solder the wires on and tape it all up. 
This didn't look so  good. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0in;">So, I took 
that apart and tried again. I  
stripped 1/4  inch insulation off the end of the wire from the modchip and decided 
to use a crimp on butt connector. If you use a crimp 
on connector you need a real small one. Only problem with them was that the 
plastic end was not big enough to handle two wires so I used a torch and heated 
a pointed scratch all. Stick it in the plastic end and widened the end. Do not 
heat the plastic end, this will not work. If you can find them, use the heat 
shrink butt connecters. They are wider at the ends. I did not know of these when 
I did this modification. Another way to splice in a wire, and I did not think of 
this at the time, is a connector I have seen a lot in automotive wiring -  a 
wiretap type connector. The ones I have seen have been blue or gray. You place 
the wires in it without cutting or removing the insulation and you squeeze the two 
halves together. They are sometimes a little big and you need to get the one for 
your size wire. [Editor note: We recommend wire taps]</p>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">My finished product looks more 
professional, at least to me. Works well and does what it is supposed to do. 
This sounds like a lot but after you do one reelstop board, the rest are easy. From start to 
finish the second machine took me maybe two to two and a half hours. This is 
un-connecting and taking out the reel assembly, disconnecting the reel stop 
board, soldering up the chip to the board, running the wires, splicing in the 
ends and putting it back together. It helped that I was already familiar with 
the machine and how it came apart. Most reel assemblies come out in one piece. 
To take out the reel stop board you can either unscrew the board and backing 
plate or unclip just the board from the backing plate. If you do this be careful 
with the underside of the board and if you plug it back in to test something on 
it you can’t touch any metal with it. If you leave it in the backing plate these 
two things are not a problem. [Editor note: you won't have to take out the reelsets 
on all machines to get to the reelstop board. This does seem to be an issue 
with Babel and Azteca Legend though]</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">This is meant to be a supplement 
to the directions that you can download from Pachislo USA, and from my personal 
experience the directions didn’t explain enough for someone like me who never 
worked on something like this before but wanted to learn and have fun fixing, 
modifying, and having fun with my pachislo machines. I hope this helps in making 
this modification easier and fun to-do. </P>
